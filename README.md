# Minerva

Welcome to Minerva!

There are over 50 unique Icons that I created using Adobe Illustrator, converting the file into an SVG and then creating a React component for each.

Each component was designed myself. Although I used material UI for the makeStyles function, I developed my own grid system as well as cards buttons etc. The idea was to replicate Material UI in a way I could then turn into an NPM package.

Plans for Minerva:
- Add a simple flashcard system for learning subjects.
